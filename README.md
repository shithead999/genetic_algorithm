# Genetic Algorithm

- creating a basic demo of genetic algorithm
- reference from the coding train
- solving the shakespeare monkey problem

## Genetic Algorithm Working 

> Genetic algorthim is a learning algorithm where we know the target and we want to find a path to it.
> Reference: [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/)
> Genetic algorithm is capable of solving NP Hard problems
> It is a machine learning algorithm

### Steps for genetic algortihm

- [x] Define Genes
- [x] Define DNA
- [x] Define Population

### Dev Todo's
 
- [x] Calculate Fitness
- [x] Natural Selection
- [x] Generate/ Reproduce New population
- [x] Add time selection entry box to control time.sleep in loop
- [x] Add colors and improve style of tkinter UI
- [x] Replace python array's with numpy array for better speed
- [x] Below the generation add 2 more labels for pop size, mutation rate
