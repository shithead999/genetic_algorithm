# Genetic Algorithm

- creating a basic demo of genetic algorithm
- reference from the coding train
- solving the shakespeare monkey problem

## Genetic Algorithm Working 

> Genetic algorthim is a learning algorithm where we know the target and we want to find a path to it.
> Reference: [The Nature of Code](https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-9-the-evolution-of-code/)
> Genetic algorithm is capable of solving NP Hard problems
> It is a machine learning algorithm
